## Understanding Data
  The AI revolution was sparked by an innovation enabling programmers to develop applications that process data as examples,
 uncovering patterns to tackle complex problems. Explore the illustration depicting machine learning.

It's clear from the illustration that data plays a vital role in machine learning. The programmer utilizes tools to align 
data with answers and uses these examples to train the model. The model's performance thrives when the programmer supplies
 ample data to encompass all scenarios for training. It's crucial to provide diverse examples to the system. Failure to do
 so can lead to a phenomenon known as overfitting. When overfitting occurs, the model struggles to perform well with examples 
it hasn't encountered during training.
## Data
Data is the information sent into, processed, and analyzed by an AI system. The system then tries to figure out the patterns 
or rules that govern the data
## Training
 An AI system is typically trained by feeding it lots of data and enabling it to figure out patterns in the data. A trained 
 model can then use these rules to solve problems using data it has not seen before! For instance, to train a machine to 
 recognize shoes, one would employ thousands of images of different types of shoes. The machine then learns to identify ‘features’ 
 common to shoes and develop patterns or rules to recognize shoes. 
## Overfitting
Overfitting is a common occurrence in machine learning. One of the reasons it occurs is when an AI system is trained using partial
or insufficient data. The system works well when asked to solve problems using the ‘training’ data but poorly when exposed to
previously unseen data. For instance, while training a machine to recognize shoes, if you only train it using images of hiking boots,
the machine will perform well if asked to recognize a hiking boot that it has not seen before but may perform poorly if shown a high heel.

Up to now, you learned that AI is really a new way of programming a computer. While programming AI, you use data that you label and computer algorithms will match the data to the labels. This will create a model, which you can then use with new data to infer the labels.

So, for example, if you show a computer lots of pictures of cats, and tell it that they are cats, and then lots of pictures of dogs and do the same — then a model that is created from this data should be able to take in an image and determine if it is a cat or a dog.
