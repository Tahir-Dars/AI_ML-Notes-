## Understanding the hype around AI:-
Artificial Intelligence is a revolutionary technology pervading different aspects of our lives. As with any 
revolutionary technology such as the personal computer, the smartphone, and the Internet, AI is also subject to hype 
that can be  visualized in a graph.

After the initial technology breakthrough in any exciting new technology, there is a peak of inflated expectations. 
 At this peak, the conversations around the technology are generally driven by ignorance, fear about what it might supplant, or doubt about its 
capabilities. As you understand what the technology does, you break out of the hype and may fall into the trough of disillusionment. In this course, I will guide you as you understand what you can do with this increasingly mature technology, which will help you move towards the plateau of productivity.
## How AI/ML Differs from Traditional Programming
|Traditional Programming| AI/ML |
| -------- | -------- |
| Formulate explicit rules for the application to follow. | Train the application as you would train an intelligent being by providing examples and enabling it to recognize patterns. |
