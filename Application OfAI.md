A key application of AI is computer vision, where one can train a machine to identify content in images. This process is akin 
to how the human eye processes images.
## Diagnosing Diabetic Retinopathy
Retinopathy is typically diagnosed by an optometrist or ophthalmologist, who examines the patient's retina image (captured through
 methods like fundoscopy or fundus photography) to determine its health status. The practitioner identifies specific features such
 as clots or hemorrhages.When training an application to diagnose retinopathy, a programmer inputs thousands of healthy and diseased
 retina images. Each image is labeled as healthy or diseased, along with disease severity (from mild to severe). The application uses
 filters to extract image features. Through training, the application learns optimal filters that enhance features distinguishing healthy
 and diseased retinas. Once trained, the application can diagnose new retinal images using these learned filters.
