Up to now, you’ve been looking at matching X values to Y values when there’s a linear relationship between them. So, for example, you matched 
the X values in this set [-1, 0 , 1, 2, 3, 4] to the Y values in this set [-3, -1, 1, 3, 5, 7] by figuring out the equation y = 2x - 1.

You then saw how a very simple neural network with a single neuron could be used for this. In Figure below, an input leads to a neuron 
as an arrow. Out of this, an output arrow is generated.

In reality, a neuron is essentially a function with two adjustable parameters known as weight and bias. The output of the neuron is calculated using the equation:

**Output=(Weight×Input)+Bias**

This equation mirrors the relationship described between X and Y, where Y = 2X - 1. Here, the weight corresponds to 2, and the bias to -1.
When multiple neurons operate together within layers, the learned weights and biases across these layers enable the neural network to discern and understand more intricate patterns. Further insights into this process will be explored in subsequent parts of the course.
