# Other AI Applications
Just as vision is one aspect of our intelligence, AI extends far beyond computer “vision”. All these applications follow the framework established in previous 
paragraphs — gathering data, labeling it, and building a model— to identify patterns that match data with its label.

The power of AI becomes apparent when we tackle complex scenarios requiring numerous rules. Detecting activities like walking, running, golfing, or swimming, 
for example, involves hundreds or even thousands of rules. This complexity is compounded by the subjective nature of these activities, which can vary based
on the individual, location, and even weather conditions! AI excels in such scenarios by using pattern matching: presenting multiple examples of each activity
type and letting the machine discern the underlying patterns and appropriate labels.

**Application

The developers at DeepMind created an AI model that defeated the world’s best at “GO,” a complex game with multiple game possibilities.**
